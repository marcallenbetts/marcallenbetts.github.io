I use [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) pretty much nonstop when 
testing. As a backup I use [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/). It lacks a bit
of the polished UI that Charles provides, but it is free and open source. And it
gets cool points for being a command line tool.

These notes cover only a fraction of what mitmproxy can do, but is pretty much
everything I need most days.


### Install
```
brew install mitmproxy
```

### Help
```
mitmproxy --help
```

### Start proxy on port 8989
```
mitmproxy --listen-port 8989 --ssl-insecure 
--set console_mouse=false
```
The ```ssl-insecure``` flag ignores insecure SSL sites, which is common in
a lot of the test environments I use. The ```console_mouse``` option makes it 
easier to copy/paste output from the terminal.

### Start reverse proxy on port 8989 that directs traffic to port 4001
```
mitmproxy —-listen-port 8989 —-ssl-insecure
-—set console_mouse=false 
-—mode reverse:http://localhost:4001
```

### Navigation
* `j`/`k`: down/up
* `enter`: select request
* `q`: back/quit
* `z`: clear requests
